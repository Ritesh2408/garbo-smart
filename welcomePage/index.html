      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        This application is an attempt to solve one of the most ignored problems
        of the society – Proper garbage handling. As you move through the pages,
        you would be entering garbage ID, the coordinates of the bin and the
        amount of garbage present in the bin. This would save the information
        you enter about the garbage bin and would accordingly update the map.
        You would also be able to access your dashboard and see the map
        depicting the location of garbage bins.

        <br />
        <br />
        The dashboard would reflect the points you receive each time you help us
        in improving the garbage-handling system of the city. The information
        related to their empty-full condition can be easily accessed through our
        webpage. The coloured garbage bins indicate 3 levels of garbage – red
        for full, yellow for partially full, and green for empty. Also, the
        percentage of garbage inside the bins is shown alongside the bin
        coordinates in a prompt. All this aims to improve user experience and
        provide an excellent interface for garbage handling.
        <br />
        <br />
        For any anonymous garbage bin, the amount of garbage that is present in
        that particular bin is detected through sensors present in the bin. And,
        by using microcontrollers (Arduino), we retrieve the information into
        our database, which in turn updates the existing status of garbage. Join
        us in our mission to make our city a smart one with smart solutions for
        a serious-yet-ignored problem – garbage handling.
